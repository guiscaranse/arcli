    This trigger will check difference in files in a Git repo.
    Example:
          trigger:
            name: GitDiff
            args: ["docker-compose.yml", "arcli/*.py]
            options:

    This will check if the difference between the current and last commit was with those files.
    If no argument is provided it will check if there where differences (will in most cases, always trigger).

    Custom options:
        onetime (bool): Check if trigger should be triggered just once for each commit.
